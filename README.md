My submission for my Masters of Data Science Capstone Project

# Introduction


## Dataset
This Tool uses the [UCI Adult (Census Income)](https://www.openml.org/d/1590) dataset.

## Data Description
This project uses the UCI Adult (Census Income) dataset. It is a widely used resource in machine learning for classification tasks. It was extracted from the US Census databate (1994) by Barry Decker and Ronny Kohavi, with the goal of predicting whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50k based on demographic and employment-related attributes.
